# What's New in TypeScript?

## TypeScript 1.1
### Performance Improvements
The 1.1 compiler is typically around 4x faster than any previous release. See [this blog post for some impressive charts.](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/typescript/archive/2014/10/06/announcing-typescript-1-1-ctp.aspx)

### Better Module Visibility Rules
TypeScript now only strictly enforces the visibility of types in modules if the `--declaration` flag is provided. This is very useful for Angular scenarios, for example:
```ts
module MyControllers {
  interface ZooScope extends ng.IScope {
    animals: Animal[];
  }
  export class ZooController {
    // Used to be an error (cannot expose ZooScope), but now is only
    // an error when trying to generate .d.ts files
    constructor(public $scope: ZooScope) { }
    /* more code */
  }
}
```

## TypeScript 1.3
### Protected
The new `protected` modifier in classes works like it does in familiar languages like C++, C#, and Java. A `protected` member of a class is visible only inside subclasses of the class in which it is declared:

```ts
class Thing {
  protected doSomething() { /* ... */ }
}

class MyThing extends Thing {
  public myMethod() {
    // OK, can access protected member from subclass
    this.doSomething();
  }
}
var t = new MyThing();
t.doSomething(); // Error, cannot call protected member from outside class
```
