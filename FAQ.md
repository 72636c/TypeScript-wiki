# Function parameters are bivariant

# All types are assignable to empty interfaces

# Why is `A<string>` assignable to `A<number>` for `interface A<T> { }`?

# Why aren't classes nominal?

# Why are enums nominal?

# Why does `this` get orphaned on my instance methods?

# Why is my output file empty when I use module exports with `--outFile`?

# Decorators on function declarations

# Getters without setters are not considered readonly

# I wrote `declare var MyComponent: React.Component;`, why can't I write `<MyComponent />`
