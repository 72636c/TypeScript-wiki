# Introduction

JSX is an embeddable XML-like syntax.
It is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript but the semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific.
JSX came to popularity with the React library but has since seen other applications.
TypeScript supports embedding, type checking, and optionally compiling JSX directly into JavaScript.

# Basic usage

In order to use JSX you must do two things.

1. Name your files with the `.tsx` extension
2. Enable the `jsx` option

TypeScript ships with two JSX modes: `preserve` and `react`.
These modes only affect the emit stage.
The `preserve` mode will keep the JSX as part of the output to be further consumed by another transform step.
Additionally the output will have a `.jsx` file extension.
The `react` mode will emit `React.createElement`, does not need to go through a JSX transformation before use, and the output will have a `.js` file extension.

Mode       | Input     | Output                       | File Extension
-----------|-----------|------------------------------|---------------
`preserve` | `<div />` | `<div />`                    | `.jsx`
`react`    | `<div />` | `React.createElement("div")` | `.js`

You can specify this mode using either the `--jsx` command line flag or the corresponding option in your [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json) file.

> *Note: The identifier `React` is hard-coded, so you must make React available with an uppercase R.*

# The `as` operator

Since TypeScript uses angle brackets for type assertions, there is a conflict when parsing between type assertions and JSX.
Consider the following code:

```JSX
var foo = <foo>bar;
</foo>
```

Is this code creating a JSX element with the content of `bar;`, or is it asserting that `bar` is of type `foo` and there is an invalid expression on line 2?
To simplify cases like this, angle bracket type assertions are not available in `.tsx` files.
As a result, in a `.tsx` file, the previous code would be interpreted as a JSX element, and in a `.ts` file it would result in an error.

To make up for this loss of functionality in `.tsx` files, a new type assertion operator has been added: `as`.

```TypeScript
var foo = bar as foo;
```

The `as` operator is available in both `.ts` and `.tsx` files.

# Type Checking

In order to understand type checking with JSX you must first understand the difference between intrinsic elements value-based elements.
Given a JSX expression `<expr />`, `expr` may either refer to something intrinsic to the environment (e.g. a `div` or `span` in a DOM environment) or to a custom component that you've created.
This is important for two reasons:

1. For React, intrinsic elements are emitted as strings (`React.createElement("div")`), whereas a component you've created is not (`React.createElement(MyComponent)`).
2. The types of the attributes being passed in the JSX element should be looked up differently. Intrinsic element attributes should be known *intrinsically* whereas components will likely want to specify their own set of attributes.

TypeScript uses the [same convention that React does](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#html-tags-vs.-react-components) for distinguishing between these.
An intrinsic element always begins with a lowercase letter, and a value-based element always begins with an uppercase letter.

## Intrinsic elements

Intrinsic elements are looked up on the special interface `JSX.IntrinsicElements`.
By default, if this interface is not specified, then anything goes and intrinsic elements will not be type checked.
However, if interface *is* present, then the name of the intrinsic element is looked up as a property on the `JSX.IntrinsicElements` interface.
For example:

```TypeScript
declare namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
        foo: any
    }
}

<foo />; // ok
<bar />; // error
```

In the above example, `<foo />` will work fine but `<bar />` will result in an error since it has not been specified on `JSX.IntrinsicElements`.

*Note: You can also specify a catch-all string indexer on `JSX.IntrinsicElements`* as follows:

```TypeScript
declare namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
        [elemName: string]: any;
    }
}
```

## Value-based elements

Value based elements are simply looked up by identifiers that are in scope.

```TypeScript
import MyComponent from "./myComponent";

<MyComponent />; // ok
<SomeOtherComponent />; // error
```

It is possible to limit the type of a value-based element.
However, for this we must introduce two new terms: the *element class type* and the *element instance type*.

Given `<Expr />`, the *element class type* is the type of `Expr`.
So in the example above, if `MyComponent` was an ES6 class the class type would be that class.
If `MyComponent` was a factory function, the class type would be that function.

Once the class type is established, the instance type is determined by the union of the return types of the class type's call signatures and construct signatures.
So again, in the case of an ES6 class, the instance type would be the type of an instance of that class, and in the case of a factory function, it would be the type of the value returned from the function.

```TypeScript
class MyComponent {
  render() {}
}

// use a construct signature
var myComponent = new MyComponent();

// element class type => MyComponent
// element instance type => { render: () => void }

function MyFactoryFunction() {
  return { 
    render: () => {
    } 
  }
}

// use a call signature
var myComponent = MyFactoryFunction();

// element class type => FactoryFunction
// element instance type => { render: () => void }
```

The element instance type is interesting because it must be assignable to `JSX.ElementClass` or it will result in an error.
By default `JSX.ElementClass` is `{}`, but it can be augmented to limit the use of JSX to only those types that conform to the proper interface.

```TypeScript
declare module JSX {
  interface ElementClass {
    render: any;
  }
}

class MyComponent {
  render() {}
}
function MyFactoryFunction() {
  return { render: () => {} }
}

<MyComponent />; // ok
<MyFactoryFunction />; // ok

class NotAValidComponent {}
function NotAValidFactoryFunction() {
	return {};
}

<NotAValidComponent />; // error
<NotAValidFactoryFunction />; // error
```

## Attribute type checking

The first step to type checking attributes is to determine the *element attributes type*.
This is slightly different between intrinsic and value-based elements.

For intrinsic elements, it is the type of the property on `JSX.IntrinsicElements`

```TypeScript
declare module JSX {
  interface IntrinsicElements {
    foo: { bar?: boolean }
  }
}

// element attributes type for `foo` is `{bar?: boolean}`
<foo bar />;
```

For value-based elements, it is a bit more complex.
It is determined by the type of a property on the *element instance type* that was previously determined.
Which property to use is determined by `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty`.
It should be declared with a single property.
The name of that property is then used.

```TypeScript
declare module JSX {
  interface ElementAttributesProperty {
    props; // specify the property name to use
  }
}

class MyComponent {
  // specify the property on the element instance type
  props: {
    foo?: string;
  }
}

// element attributes type for `MyComponent` is `{foo?: string}`
<MyComponent foo="bar" />
```

The element attribute type is used to type check the attributes in the JSX.
Optional and required properties are supported.

```TypeScript
declare module JSX {
  interface IntrinsicElements {
    foo: { requiredProp: string; optionalProp?: number }
  }
}

<foo requiredProp="bar" />; // ok
<foo requiredProp="bar" optionalProp={0} />; // ok
<foo />; // error, requiredProp is missing
<foo requiredProp={0} />; // error, requiredProp should be a string
<foo requiredProp="bar" unknownProp />; // error, unknownProp does not exist
<foo requiredProp="bar" some-unknown-prop />; // ok, because `some-unknown-prop` is not a valid identifier
```

>*Note: If an attribute name is not a valid JS identifier (like a `data-*` attribute), it is not considered to be an error if it is not found in the element attributes type.*

The spread operator also works:

```JSX
var props = { requiredProp: 'bar' };
<foo {...props} />; // ok

var badProps = {};
<foo {...badProps} />; // error
```

# The JSX result type

By default the result of a JSX expression is typed as `any`.
You can customize the type by specifying the `JSX.Element` interface.
However, it is not possible to retrieve type information about the element, attributes or children of the JSX from this interface.
It is a black box.

# Escaping to TypeScript

JSX in JavaScript allows you to escape to JavaScript by using curly braces `{ }`.
JSX in TypeScript allows you to do the same thing, but you escape to TypeScript.
That means transpilation features and type checking still work when embedded within JSX.

```JSX
var a = <div>
  {['foo', 'bar'].map(i => <span>{i/2}</span>)}
</div>
```

The above code will result in an error since you cannot divide a string by a number.
The output, when using the `preserve` option, looks like:

```JSX
var a = <div>
  {['foo', 'bar'].map(function (i) { return <span>{i / 2}</span>; })}
</div>
```

# React integration

To use JSX with React you should use the [React typings](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/react).
These typings define the `JSX` namespace appropriately for use with React.

```TypeScript
/// <reference path="react.d.ts" />

interface Props {
  foo: string;
}

class MyComponent extends React.Component<Props, {}> {
  render() {
    return <span>{this.props.foo}</span>
  }
}

<MyComponent foo="bar" />; // ok
<MyComponent foo={0} />; // error
```
